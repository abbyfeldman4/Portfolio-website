        <h2>Vienna’s Plant-Based Movement and the European Trend</h2>
        <p>
            The rise of veganism in Vienna is not an isolated trend. Vienna’s plant-based movement is part of a larger European trend, as other cities adopt similar policies and consumer habits. Many countries across Europe are also adopting more meat-free diets and sustainability initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of 2023, 2.6 million people in Europe identify as Vegan, according to the Vegan Society. That is about 3.2% of the European population, comparable to the entire population of Vienna or even larger than some European Union countries like Latvia or Slovenia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond strict veganism, a flexitarian diet shift is evident, with 11.1% of Europeans following a flexitarian diet and 23% actively reducing their meat intake, according to the Vegan Society. Countries such as the Netherlands (42%) and Romania (40%) report some of the highest flexitarian adoption rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dietary shift is reflected in plant-based food sales, which have risen by 22% since 2020. Austria alone saw a 57% increase in plant-based food sales between 2018 and 2020. Additionally, the European meat substitute market is rapidly expanding, with seitan—a high-protein meat substitute made from wheat gluten—experiencing a 9.8% annual growth rate, according to the Vegan Society.
