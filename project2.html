        <h3>About this Project</h3>
        <p>Matt Lancor found his love for Kombucha through needing a refreshment. As a D1 rugby player, he went to the sidelines to quench his thirst. Realizing what he was drinking was kombucha, he fell in love with it and started making it out of his mom's kitchen. Here is his company's story.</p>
