            <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Abby and I am a multimedia journalist who is passionate about visual storytelling. I have a deep passion for storytelling, particularly when it comes to those who are often marginalized or unheard. I believe that through my work, I have the ability to bring attention to issues that are both important and meaningful. In a world where it can be challenging to find balanced, objective reporting, I am committed to providing informative, well-researched pieces that engage and educate readers. From local news stories, to features, to broader issues affecting communities worldwide, I am here to make a different, to lift up voices, and to help others see the power of storytelling in affecting real and lasting change. </p>
